8:35 - 9:13 

Topic: Engineers love to over-engineer. Once something becomes standardized and less shiny, they move on to the next shiny thing.

Thoughts: As my wife and I were driving to meet up with friends, and I was listening to this podcast, she looked at me and said, "This is sooooo you." You know you're an engineer at heart if you want to over-complicate something that could be done in a much simpler way...lol

9:55 - 10:33

Topic: People think, "I must do the most complicated thing I can do to get hired in ML." But instead, show actual progress and what you'd achieved - don't focus on how you got there.

Thoughts: As someone who is trying to get into ML, I feel this pain of wanting to do the most complicated thing I can to show people that I havewhat it takes to get hired. However, whenever I try this, I usually fail to complete the project. So yes, getting a simpler and easier project complete is better than a super complex and hard unfished project.

10:55 - 11:08

Topic: It is hard, but you must fight to keep things simple in business-critial systems.
